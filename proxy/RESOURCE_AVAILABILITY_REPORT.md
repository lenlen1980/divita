- JS: `https://divita.ae/assets/external/framer/sites/6f2zhLOQNAO3RzGM9yLEzZ/*`

### ✅ Working Proxy Resources

#### Google Fonts
- API endpoint: `/proxy/fonts/api/` → Successfully proxying fonts.googleapis.com
- CSS requests working correctly
- Font files loading through proxy

### ⚠️ Remaining Issue (1% of resources)

#### Atlist Interactive Map (iframe)
- **Issue**: CloudFront SSL handshake failure prevents proxying
- **Type**: Interactive iframe content (not static resource)
- **Impact**: Map widget not displaying

**Recommended Solutions:**
1. Replace with alternative map service (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Mapbox)
2. Contact Atlist for direct API access or embed code that works in Russia
3. Create static map image as fallback

## Summary

**Achieved 99% resource availability:**
- ✅ 55/56 static resources successfully localized
- ✅ Google Fonts working through proxy
- ⚠️ 1 interactive iframe requires alternative solution

All critical resources for site functionality and appearance are now available.
Only the embedded map widget remains non-functional due to CloudFront limitations.
